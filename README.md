This app was developed by Lydia Antonova and Miriam Hamzaoui as a project for Mental Awareness Month.
It was built with careful planning, utilizing pair programming techniques, and applying the concepts learned in React development. 

The app combines the power of React components, fetching data from an external API, and populating the API with user input to create a dynamic and interactive experience.
